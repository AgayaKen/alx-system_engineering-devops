1. DNS Request
The first step is the Domain Name System (DNS) request. Your browser needs to convert the human-readable domain name (www.google.com) into an IP address that your computers can understand. It sends a DNS query to a DNS server, which responds with the IP address of Google’s server1.
2. TCP/IP Connection
With the IP address in hand, your browser initiates a connection to the server using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). TCP ensures reliable data transmission by breaking data into packets and reassembling them at the destination. IP handles the routing of these packets to the correct address2.
3. Firewall
Before the connection is established, your computer’s firewall checks the incoming and outgoing packets to ensure they are safe and not malicious. This step helps protect your system from potential threats3.
4. HTTPS/SSL
Once the connection is secure, your browser establishes an HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) connection. This involves an SSL/TLS handshake, where your browser and the server agree on encryption methods to secure the data being transmitted. This ensures that any data exchanged is encrypted and secure.
5. Load Balancer
The request then reaches Google’s load balancer, which distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed. This helps maintain performance and reliability5.
6. Web Server
The load balancer forwards the request to one of Google’s web servers. The web server processes the request, retrieves the necessary resources (like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files), and prepares a response6.
7. Application Server
If the web server needs additional data or processing, it communicates with an application server. The application server handles more complex tasks, such as running backend logic or interacting with databases.
8. Database
Finally, if the request requires data storage or retrieval, the application server queries a database. The database stores information like user data, search indexes, and other relevant data. The application server retrieves the necessary data and sends it back to the web server.
